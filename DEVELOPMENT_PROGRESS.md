### Database Schema Updates

#### Modified Models
- **User Model** (`prisma/schema.prisma`):
  - Changed `password` field to optional (for OAuth support)
  - Changed `emailVerified` from Boolean to DateTime (NextAuth requirement)
  - Added relationships for `accounts` and `sessions`

#### New Models Added
- **Account** - OAuth account connections
- **Session** - User sessions
- **VerificationToken** - Email verification tokens

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files

4. `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth API route
5. `/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Registration endpoint
6. `/src/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - SessionProvider wrapper
7. `/scripts/create-test-user.js` - Script to create test users

REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_DB=0

# AWS S3 Configuration (Required for file uploads)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key-here
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name-here
```

#### Redis Connection (`/src/lib/redis.ts`)

- ‚úÖ Lazy connection to prevent startup failures
- ‚úÖ Connection state tracking
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback when Redis unavailable

#### Queue Module (`/src/lib/queue.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Fallback handling for Redis connection failures
- ‚úÖ Mock job objects when Redis unavailable

2. **`npm run workers:dev`** - Start workers with auto-reload
3. **`npm run check:redis`** - Test Redis connection
4. **`npm run dev:all`** - Run app and workers together

### Files Created
- `/scripts/check-redis.js` - Redis connection tester
- `/src/scripts/start-workers.ts` - Worker startup script
- `/REDIS_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive Redis setup guide

### Key Features
1. **Graceful Degradation** - App runs without Redis, skipping background jobs
2. **Clear Feedback** - Console warnings when jobs are skipped
3. **Easy Setup** - Detailed instructions for all platforms
4. **Development Friendly** - Combined dev command for app + workers

### Running the Application

#### With Redis (Full Features)
```bash
# Install and start Redis first
brew install redis && brew services start redis

# Run everything
npm run dev:all

# Or separately:
npm run dev      # Terminal 1
npm run workers  # Terminal 2
```

#### Without Redis (Limited Features)

## üè† Home Page Fix - Public Access (2025-01-30)

### Overview
Fixed 401 authentication errors on the home page by creating a public landing page that doesn't require authentication.

### Issue
- Home page was using `DashboardContentConnected` component
- This component makes API calls to `/api/profile` and `/api/analytics/overview`
- These endpoints require authentication, causing 401 errors for non-logged-in users

### Solution
1. Created new `HomeContent` component (`/src/components/HomeContent.tsx`)
   - Public landing page with hero section
   - Feature showcase
   - Statistics display
   - Call-to-action sections
   - No API calls required

2. Updated home page (`/src/app/[lng]/page.tsx`)
   - Replaced `DashboardContentConnected` with `HomeContent`
   - Removed all authenticated API dependencies
   - Kept public navigation and footer

### Key Changes
- ‚úÖ Home page now accessible without login
- ‚úÖ No more 401 errors on initial load
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between public and authenticated content
- ‚úÖ Dashboard functionality moved to `/dashboard` route (requires auth)

### User Flow
1. **Public users** ‚Üí Land on home page ‚Üí See features ‚Üí Sign up/Sign in
2. **Authenticated users** ‚Üí Redirected to dashboard after login
3. **Dashboard access** ‚Üí Available at `/dashboard` (protected route)

## üîì Explore Page Public Access Fix (2025-01-30)

### Overview
Fixed 401 authentication errors on the `/explore` page by making the assets and search APIs publicly accessible for viewing public content.

### Issue
- Explore page was calling `/api/assets` and `/api/search` endpoints
- Both endpoints required authentication
- Public users couldn't browse public assets

### Solution

#### 1. Created Optional Authentication Helper
Added `optionalAuth` function in `/src/lib/auth-middleware.ts`:
```typescript
export async function optionalAuth(req?: NextRequest) {
  const user = await getAuthUser(req)
  return { user, error: null }
}
```

#### 2. Updated `/api/assets` Endpoint
- Changed from `requireAuth` to `optionalAuth`
- Added filtering for unauthenticated users:
  - Only show assets with `usage: PUBLIC`
  - Only show assets with `readyForPublishing: true`
- Authenticated users see all assets they have permission to view

#### 3. Updated `/api/search` Endpoint
- Changed from `requireAuth` to `optionalAuth`
- Updated search service to accept `userId: string | null`
- Added automatic filters for unauthenticated users
- Public users only search public, published content

### Key Changes
- ‚úÖ Explore page accessible without login
- ‚úÖ Public users can browse public assets
- ‚úÖ Search functionality works for public content
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users still see all permitted content
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposed to public users

### Security Considerations
- Public users only see assets marked as `PUBLIC` and `readyForPublishing`
- No user information exposed for public assets
- Download URLs still require appropriate permissions
- API maintains backward compatibility for authenticated users
