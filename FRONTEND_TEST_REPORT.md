## üîß Recommendations

### High Priority

4. **Resolve Redis Issues**: Fix connection for caching functionality

### Medium Priority
1. **Add User Profile Page**: Complete user management features
2. **Improve Anonymous User Experience**: Fix loading issues for public assets
3. **Add Error Boundaries**: Better error handling for failed API requests
4. **Optimize Bundle Size**: Asset detail page taking too long to compile

### Low Priority
1. **Add Loading Skeletons**: Better UX during data fetching
2. **Implement Breadcrumbs**: Improve navigation
3. **Add Pagination Controls**: For large asset lists
4. **Complete French Translations**: Some text still in English

## üéØ Overall Assessment

The Content Hub application has a **solid foundation** with core features working, but needs attention to:
1. Complete unimplemented pages (Notifications, Profile, Asset Detail)
2. Fix configuration issues (S3, Redis)
3. Improve error handling and loading states
4. Optimize performance for complex pages

**Recommendation**: Address critical issues before production deployment, particularly the asset detail page timeout and missing notification system.
